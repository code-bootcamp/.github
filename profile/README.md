# üéì Review by Graduate

- [If you ask me if it's codecamp even if I choose again, my answer is yes](https://velog.io/@kim_truee/%EC%8A%AC%EA%B8%B0%EB%A1%9C%EC%9A%B4-%EC%BD%94%EC%BA%A0%EC%83%9D%ED%99%9C-%ED%94%84%EB%A1%A0%ED%8A%B8%EC%97%94%EB%93%9C%ED%8E%B8)
    > If I look back on whether I was a hard worker in the front-end class, I don't think that's necessarily the case. But I was able to understand the function of the front end, and I was able to create a service. I think all of this was possible because it was a 'codecamp'.

<br>

- [Along with development knowledge, you will learn collaboration skills, communication skills, and mindset that you should have as a developer](https://velog.io/@ektmf4411/%EC%BD%94%EB%93%9C%EC%BA%A0%ED%94%84codecamp-%EC%88%98%EB%A3%8C-%ED%9B%84%EA%B8%B0?utm_source=boottent&utm_medium=referral)
    > It constantly emphasizes not only communication and collaboration skills but also how to study on its own and trains them so that they can solve it alone. You can learn how to work like a real developer, and you can develop the ability to solve it alone because it experiences many errors you experience during development and guides you on how to solve them.

<br>

- [I can proudly say that codecamp teaches you a lot. If you can endure life in the camp, you can learn a lot.](https://velog.io/@yukina1418/%EC%BD%94%EB%93%9C%EC%BA%A0%ED%94%84-%EC%88%98%EB%A3%8C-%ED%9B%84%EA%B8%B0?utm_source=boottent&utm_medium=referral#%EA%B2%B0%EB%A1%A0)
    > I looked at the official explanation and wondered if I could learn all of that. And I still remember proudly saying that it was possible in the pre-registration consultation. If you want to study properly, I highly recommend codecamp.

<br>

- [codecamp is a boot camp that is sincere to the students and is sincere about the curriculum.](https://velog.io/@sjy0917/Code.Camp-%ED%9B%84%EA%B8%B0?utm_source=boottent)
    > With the expectation that the program created with the team members through the corporate collaboration program will be used in practice, it seems to have grown the most since I started studying.

<br>

- [If you ask me what I've grown up in, I want to say "everything."](https://velog.io/@takk2/%EC%BD%94%EB%93%9C%EC%BA%A0%ED%94%84%ED%9A%8C%EA%B3%A0?utm_source=boottent)
    > I had a hard time designing a simple structure, so I brought an API, showed the information I wanted, implemented the function to enter the product, and wouldn't it be right to say that this has definitely increased? Like the teachers here, I want to be a developer who can be the envy of having the ability to confidently inform someone.

<br>
<br>

# üìÜ Program Configuration
## step 1 - basecamp
> From the sprint program with Pair Friends to a refreshing guide through metaverse. Every day, I organize what I learned, share it with my colleagues, and expand my thinking.
<br>
<br>

## step 2 - bootcamp
> By experiencing various experiences with a systematic schedule, you can find solutions from a wide perspective when faced with various problems.

> The developer teacher is in charge of taking care of the student to the small part.

> In order to be able to actively solve the same problem, guide the answer in a way that can be found without directly telling the answer.
<br>
<br>

## step 3 - Team project
> To complete the team portfolio and make each member's capabilities stand out, coaching team products is provided every week.
<br>
<br>

## step 4 - Employment Procedure Support Program
> Collect the know-how of graduates and provide it to you.

> We provides a way to write a resume that makes it easy to get a job, and how to find a good company.

> Recruitment consulting experts match companies that suit individuals and continue to provide support for employment through partner companies such as "Jumpit," "Talent X," and "codecamp R."
<br>
<br>

## step 5 - community
> You can communicate freely through the community where all the members are gathered.
<br>
<br>
